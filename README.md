A simple blog project using HTML and CSS. This project is part of the Udacity Frontend Developer Program.

Tech Stack:
-Semantic HTML5 (for web accessibility).
-CSS (flexbox, grid layout).
-Implemented CSS BEM Naming Convention.
-Responsive Web Design
-The semantic HTML and CSS BEM were added to challenge myself. Those were not in the course.
